I along with my teammates worked on a strategy building project 
to reduce costs associated with career development, cost incurred due to frequent acquisitions and to increase employee retention rate.


Outcome: We identified the stakeholders involved, brainstormed business questions and came up with 4 actionable scores namely
Program Effectiveness Score, Skill Readiness Index, Candidate Alignment Score and Organization Health Score 
that the HR team could utilize to achieve their career developmental goals.

I would like to thank all my teammates for their inputs and continued efforts.
