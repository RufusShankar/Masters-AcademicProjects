As a part of the module MIS41130, Statistical Methods,
I worked on a statistics project that studied healthcare performance across the measures
- life expectancy at birth, maternal mortality rate, Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIVAIDS) and Measles 
against investment for OECD countries Vs non-OECD countries. 
This involved performing descriptive stats, hypothesis tests against benchmark values and hypothesis of regression.

This was a group project and I would like to thank my teammates Bhargav Bachanahalli Shekarmurthy,Vignesh Yalagondahalli Sreenath
for their continued support.
